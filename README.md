If you'd like to contribute, you should join our [discord](https://discord.pixelsimulator.repl.co) and make suggestions there! Bug reports should be reported *here*, though. Code contributions likely won't make it since there isn't mch complexity and it would be hard to make a good code contribution anyways.
